lwes-python
===========

Pure Python LWES Client

This is a 80% solution to LWES.  It can communicate with an LWES event listener, and sends data correctly.  It has not been tested fully though, and does not support every LWES feature, such as heartbeats.  This is a side project, and over time may become a proper LWES client.

This project was started to support a mondemand python client.  The functions needed for Mondemand are fully supported, but remain untested.  I have yet to see what happens if there are any network/socket issues.
